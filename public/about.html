<h1>About Me</h1>

As the founder of DOS Technologies, I design AI driven platforms that eliminate administrative friction, optimize revenue workflows, and improve care delivery. My work centers on transforming fragmented healthcare processes into scalable, data powered infrastructure with measurable business impact.</p>
<p>I specialize in healthcare automation, claims lifecycle intelligence, operational analytics, and product strategy. I work at the intersection of AI, enterprise systems, and clinical realities, translating complex workflows into structured, deployable solutions. My approach combines market insight with system architecture, allowing me to create products that align operational efficiency with patient experience while meeting the demands of real world healthcare environments.</p>
<p>I build with clarity, execution, and scale in mind. My mission is to lead the next generation of healthcare intelligence starting with dental and expanding into broader medical applications. I focus on outcomes over optics, infrastructure over features, and long term impact over short term wins. I am driven by results and committed to creating healthcare technology that actually works.</p>
